## Problem Statement
 You are a data analyst working for a car dealership. You have received a CSV file containing sales data.
 Your goal is to understand the sales pattern, customer behavior, and make visual insights using Python basics,
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Your job includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Basic analysis
- OOP implementation
- Visualization
- Extracting insights

## Results
Excited to share my latest data analytics project where I explored real-world car sales data to uncover valuable insights for dealerships and buyers.
Key highlights:
* Cleaned and preprocessed messy CSV data using Pandas and NumPy
* Used OOP to structure modular and reusable analysis code
* Built visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore:
    * Top car brands/models by average price
    * Price trends vs. kms travelled and year
    * Fuel type preferences and cost analysis
* Extracted business-friendly insights to help understand customer behavior and pricing strategy
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OOP
